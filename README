it uses the S.I. (system international ) metrics kg and cm (or meters)
but if your really want in other metrics your are free to change it


giving a how tall (in cm or meters ) and how heavy (in kg ) someone is 
it tells  what classification he/she belongs 
it also tells how much kg somebody should lose to be Normal (if he/she is fat )
It currently follows the rules according to
