pyBMI is an extremely tiny library that prints the Body mass index of a person 
it uses the S.I. (system international ) metrics kg and cm (or meters)
but if your really want in other metrics your are free to change it


giving a how tall (in cm or meters ) and how heavy (in kg ) someone is 
it tells  what classification he/she belongs 
it also tells how much kilos somebody should loose to be Normal (if he/she is fat )
It currently follows the rules according to 
http://apps.who.int/bmi/index.jsp?introPage=intro_3.html

The reason i made this is... 
because 
I was annoyed by the fact that i couldn't find any BMI programm online
that tells you automatically how much killos to loose in order to become normal,
most tools give you only your BMI as a number ... and then you 
have to solve each time these tiny equations 
ofcourse the reason that people is fat is not that they are lazy doing these little math
but because of other known reasons.... :-)

Minimum kilos to loose to be normal (Normal range):

	Maximum = YOURKILOS - (YOURKILOS * 24.99) / YOURS BMI

Maximum kilos to loose to be Normal (Best fitness,slim):

	Minimum = YOURKILOS - (YOURKILOS * 18.55) / YOURS BMI
