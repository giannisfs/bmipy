pyBMI is an extremely tiny library that prints the Body mass index of a person 
it uses the S.I. (system international ) metrics kg and cm (or meters)
but if your really want in other metrics your are free to change it


giving a how tall (in cm or meters ) and how heavy (in kg ) someone is 
it tells  what classification he/she belongs 
it also tells how much kilos somebody should loose to be Normal (if he/she is fat )
It currently follows the rules according to 
http://apps.who.int/bmi/index.jsp?introPage=intro_3.html

The reason i made this is... 
because 
I was annoyed by the fact that i couldn't find any BMI programm online
that suggests an amount of weight to loose.

The formulas are the following:

Minimum kilos to loose to be normal (Normal range):

	Maximum = YOURWEIGHT- (YOURWEIGHT * 24.99) / YOURS BMI

Maximum kilos to loose to be Normal (Best fitness,slim):

	Minimum = YOURWEIGHT - (YOURWEIGHT * 18.55) / YOURS BMI
